# Craft CMS 5 PHP Guidelines

Complete PHP coding standards and conventions for Craft CMS 5 plugin and module development. These extend Craft's official coding guidelines with project-specific conventions.

**Core principles:** PHPDocs on everything — classes, methods, and properties — regardless of type hints. No `declare(strict_types=1)` in plugin source files (matching Craft core convention).

## Companion Skills — Always Load Together

- **`craftcms`** — Architecture patterns, element lifecycle, controllers, events, migrations. Required for any Craft plugin or module development.
- **`ddev`** — All commands run through DDEV. Required for running ECS, PHPStan, scaffolding, and tests.

## Documentation

- Official coding guidelines: https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/extend/coding-guidelines.html
- Class reference: https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v5/
- Generator reference: https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/extend/generator.html

When unsure about a convention, `WebFetch` the coding guidelines page for the authoritative answer.

## Common Pitfalls

- `addSelect()` is the convention in `beforePrepare()` — safely additive when multiple extensions contribute columns.
- `$_instances` is not a Craft convention — private properties use underscore prefix but meaningful names like `$_items`, `$_sections`.
- Records use the **same class name** as models (namespace distinguishes). Alias when importing both: `use ...\records\MyEntity as MyEntityRecord;`.
- Queue jobs have **no "Job" suffix** — `ResaveElements`, not `ResaveElementsJob`.
- `declare(strict_types=1)` is NOT used in plugin source files. Only in standalone config files like `ecs.php`.
- `@author` goes on classes and methods only — never on properties. (Craft *core* puts `@author` at the class level only; placing it on methods too is this project's house convention, not core style.)
- Don't use `string|null` — use `?string` (short nullable notation).
- Forget `parent::defineRules()` and you lose all inherited validation.
- Using `[$this, '_validateFoo']` callable arrays or inline closures in `defineRules()` — Craft core uses string method names: `[['attr'], 'validateAttr']`. The validator method is public, no underscore — Yii invokes it by name.
- `DateTimeHelper` in elements/queries, `Carbon` in services — never mix in the same class.
- Parsing a raw DB datetime with `strtotime()` or `new DateTime()` — those columns are naive UTC strings and the process timezone is `system.timeZone`, so the result is off by the full offset on any non-UTC install. Parse with an explicit UTC zone. See Date Handling below.
- Missing `@throws` chains — document exceptions from called methods too, not just your own throws.
- Using magic property access (`$plugin->settings`, `$app->view`) instead of explicit getters (`$plugin->getSettings()`, `$app->getView()`) — PHPStan can't resolve `__get()` calls, so magic access passes at runtime but fails static analysis. Always use explicit getters for Yii2 components and Craft plugin properties.
- Calling Craft-specific methods directly on `Craft::$app` (`Craft::$app->getConfig()`) — PHPStan can't resolve them because the static type is Yii's base union. Narrow with a typed local: `/** @var \craft\web\Application $app */ $app = Craft::$app;`. Don't use `@phpstan-ignore-line`.
- Duplicating contract constants as `private const` across multiple classes with "keep in lockstep" comments — PHPStan can't detect drift. Declare `public const` on the owning service, reference as `OwnerService::CONSTANT_NAME` everywhere else. This applies specifically to **permission handles**: a handle like `'my-plugin:manage-settings'` is a contract string referenced from registration (`EVENT_REGISTER_PERMISSIONS`), the controller gate (`requirePermission()`), and the nav check (`->can()`); a bare literal drifts silently and a typo passes for admins (who hold every permission) while denying everyone else. Declare it as a `public const` on the controller that enforces it — `SettingsController::PERMISSION_MANAGE_SETTINGS` — and reference the const everywhere. (Craft core uses bare literals here; the const is a deliberately stricter house rule. See the `craftcms` skill's `permissions.md`.)
- Writing the same authorization check separately in a CP controller, a console command, and a GraphQL resolver — they drift, and the surface that drifts is the one nobody tests. One shared gate method called by every surface, with a test per surface. Console is not exempt (a documented cron path with no permission check is an unauthenticated capability), and GraphQL schema scope is **not** the plugin's permission matrix. See `references/authorization-parity.md`.
- Assuming Craft prevents self-approval / self-review — it has no such concept, and peer permissions are the opposite axis. Write the guard into the shared gate, orthogonal to role checks, with an explicit bypass permission. See `references/authorization-parity.md`.
- Shipping `../*` path repositories in a plugin's `composer.json` — resolution works only on the author's disk. Unpublished sibling deps get a `vcs` entry; Packagist deps need nothing; `composer.lock` stays gitignored for plugins. Prove it with `composer config --global repositories` (expect empty) then a no-lock `composer update --dry-run`. See `references/tooling.md` (Composer Hygiene).
- Using `Db::parseParam()` for a literal comparison — a leading or trailing `*` becomes a SQL `LIKE` wildcard, so a uniqueness check on a stored pattern silently becomes a prefix match. Use a raw `andWhere(['col' => $value])`. See the `craftcms` skill's `architecture.md`.
- Registering `EVENT_REGISTER_ELEMENT_TYPES` / `EVENT_REGISTER_FIELD_TYPES` inside a `getIsCpRequest()` (or other request-context) branch in `init()` — component-type registration must run in **every** context (CP, console, site) or the type disappears from `getAllElementTypes()` in console/queue requests, and `Gc::hardDeleteElements()` silently stops purging its trashed rows. Register unconditionally; only CP-*rendering*/routing (URL rules, asset bundles, nav) may be gated. See the `craftcms` skill's `events.md` → "Registration scope".

## Reference Files

Read the relevant reference file(s) for your task:

| Task | Read |
|------|------|
| Writing PHPDocs, `@author`, `@since`, `@throws`, `@var`, `@param`, type references | `references/phpdoc-standards.md` |
| Class structure, section headers, ordering, enums, control flow, comments, whitespace | `references/class-organization.md` |
| Naming classes, methods, properties, files, services, events, migrations | `references/naming-conventions.md` |
| CP Twig templates, form macros, translations, file headers, validation | `references/templates-and-patterns.md` |
| ECS, PHPStan, scaffolding commands, composer hygiene for plugin repos, commit messages | `references/tooling.md` |
| Authorization parity across CP / console / GraphQL / queue surfaces, self-referential guards, one shared gate | `references/authorization-parity.md` |

## Critical Rules

1. PHPDocs on everything: classes, methods, properties. No exceptions.
2. `@throws` chains: document every exception including uncaught from called methods.
3. `@author` and `@since` at the bottom of class/method docblocks, after a blank line.
4. Section headers with `// =========================================================================` on every class. (Craft *core* itself uses dash separators — `// ----` — with functional/domain labels like `// Statuses` or `// Events`. The `=====` separators and visibility labels below are a deliberate house convention for consistency across this project's plugins, not core style.)
5. `declare(strict_types=1)` is NOT used in plugin source files — Craft's internal type coercion depends on PHP's default weak typing mode.
6. Private methods/properties prefixed with underscore: `_registerCpUrlRules()`, `$_items`.
7. `addSelect()` convention in `beforePrepare()` — additive across extensions, prevents column conflicts.
8. `DateTimeHelper` in elements/queries, `Carbon` in services — separate concerns prevent mixing date APIs in the same class.
9. Always scaffold with `ddev craft make <type> --with-docblocks`, then customize.
10. `ddev composer check-cs` and `ddev composer phpstan` must pass before every commit.

## PHP Standards

- Minimum PHP 8.2 (Craft CMS 5 requirement).
- PSR-12 baseline with Craft modifications (trailing commas, constant visibility).
- `craftcms/ecs` with `SetList::CRAFT_CMS_4` preset (covers both Craft 4 and 5).
- Short nullable notation: `?string` not `string|null`.
- Always specify `void` return types.
- Typed properties everywhere. No untyped public properties.
- Strict comparison always: `$foo === null`, `in_array($x, $y, true)`.
- Casts over functions: `(int)$foo` not `intval($foo)`.

## Section Header Order

```
// Traits
// Const Properties
// Static Properties
// Public Properties
// Protected Properties
// Private Properties
// Public Methods
// Protected Methods
// Private Methods
```

Only include sections that have content. Blank line after the separator, before the first item.

## Control Flow

- **Happy path last.** Handle error conditions first with early returns.
- **Avoid `else`** — use early returns instead.
- **Prefer `match` over `switch`** for value-mapping and returns. The official guideline is "don't use `switch` when a single `if` suffices"; `switch` remains acceptable where it reads more clearly (and is common in core).
- **Always use curly brackets** even for single statements.
- **Separate compound conditions** into nested `if` statements for readability.
- **Named arguments** when calling methods with 3+ parameters.

## Date Handling

- **Elements and element queries**: `craft\helpers\DateTimeHelper`.
- **Services** (date arithmetic): `Carbon\Carbon`.
- Never mix both in the same class.
- **Name the timezone when parsing a value that came out of the database.** Datetime columns hold naive UTC strings (`Db::prepareDateForDb()` formats in UTC without an offset), while Craft sets the PHP process timezone to `system.timeZone` — so `strtotime()` or bare `new DateTime()` on a raw column value shifts every comparison by the full UTC offset on a non-UTC install, and is silently correct on a UTC one. Use `DateTimeHelper::toDateTime($value)` (naive input is assumed UTC by default) or `Carbon::createFromFormat('Y-m-d H:i:s', $value, 'UTC')`. See the `craftcms` skill's `architecture.md` (Record-to-Model Hydration Boundary → Those strings are naive UTC).

## Environment Access

- **`craft\helpers\App::env('VAR')`, never `getenv()`** — in plugin code AND in every config-file example that appears in docs. `getenv()` is not thread-safe, returns `string|false`, and skips values only present in `$_SERVER`; `App::env()` is Craft's own convention, normalizes `'true'`/`'false'` to booleans, and is what core docs show. A config example gets the `use craft\helpers\App;` line.
- `App::parseEnv()` when the stored value may be a `$VAR` reference or an alias (settings-model getters resolving env-able fields).

## Database Conventions

- `[[column]]` quoting in Yii2 join conditions.
- `addSelect()` in `beforePrepare()` — safely additive.
- `postDate` and `expiryDate` in `addSelect()` and indexed on element tables.
- `Db::parseParam()` for query parameters. `Db::parseDateParam()` for dates. But **not** for literal comparison — it treats a leading/trailing `*` as a `LIKE` wildcard; use a raw `andWhere(['col' => $value])` when comparing stored values exactly.
- Foreign keys with explicit `CASCADE` / `SET NULL` behavior.

## Permission Handles

**Permission handles are kebab-case (`handle:manage-settings`); never camelCase.** Both halves are lowercase kebab — `savepoint:manage-settings`, `multiplayer:take-over-field`, not `savepoint:manageSettings`.

Craft lowercases permission names into `userpermissions.name`, so case is discarded on the way to storage: `manageSettings` collapses to `managesettings`, while `manage-settings` keeps its word boundaries and stays readable in the database, in exports, and in debug output.

**Craft core's own permissions are camelCase** (`accessCp`, `editUsers`, `viewPeerEntries`). This is a deliberate divergence for plugin-owned handles — don't "correct" plugin handles back to camelCase for consistency with core, and don't rewrite core's handles.

The PHP constant holding the handle stays `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (`PERMISSION_MANAGE_SETTINGS`); only the string value is kebab. Full mechanics in the `craftcms` skill's `permissions.md`.

## Naming Quick-Reference

| Thing | Convention | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Services (resource) | Plural | `Entries`, `Volumes`, `Users` |
| Services (utility) | Domain noun | `Auth`, `Search`, `Gc` |
| Queue jobs | Action verb, no suffix | `ResaveElements`, `UpdateSearchIndex` |
| Records | Same name as model | Namespace distinguishes |
| Events | Three patterns | `SectionEvent`, `RegisterUrlRulesEvent`, `DefineHtmlEvent` |
| Element actions | Action verb, no suffix | `Delete`, `Duplicate`, `SetStatus` |
| Enums | PascalCase cases, string/int backed | `PropagationMethod`, `CmsEdition` |

For the complete naming reference including file structure conventions, read `references/naming-conventions.md`.

## Copy style

Never use em-dashes (—) or en-dashes (–) in user-facing copy: field labels and instructions, `Craft::t()` strings, CP notices and flash messages, console command output, plugin/module README, and docs. Use commas, periods, colons, or parentheses instead; for ranges write "4 to 10" or a plain ASCII hyphen ("4-10"). Plain hyphens are fine. Code comments and PHPDoc are exempt. Grep for `—` and `–` in your `Craft::t()` strings, templates, and docs before finishing. (Front-end Twig copy: see the `craft-twig-guidelines` skill, which carries the same rule for `|t` strings and template text.)

## Console controller docblocks are terminal help

Yii renders console controller docblocks VERBATIM as operator-facing help, with no inline-tag resolution: the class docblock's second line becomes the command summary in `craft help`, the prose up to the first `@tag` becomes the `help <command>` body, each action method's docblock first line becomes that action's description, and option properties' `@var` text becomes `--option` help. Therefore, in every class extending `yii\console\Controller`: no `{@see}`/`{@link}`/`{@inheritdoc}` in class/property docblocks or action-method first lines (write command ids as plain text instead), no `=========` section-header rule as docblock line 2 (it prints as the command summary), no hanging-indent continuation lines on option `@var` tags (they render as ragged indents; match `craftcms/cms` `ResaveController`'s flush style), and the summary sentence goes on line 2. Verify with `ddev craft help <plugin>` — `craft help | grep '{@'` must return nothing.

Three specifics that survive that rule and still bite:

- **The summary is docblock line 2 *physically*, not the first sentence.** `parseDocCommentSummary()` (`yii\console\Controller`) returns `trim($docLines[1])` and nothing more — a first sentence that wraps onto line 3 prints only the fragment on line 2 (real summaries truncated at "and writes", "whether every row", "prints the new"). Keep the whole summary sentence on one physical line, even if it exceeds the usual wrap width.
- **A scaffolded `* Class FooController` on line 2 becomes the `craft help` summary verbatim.** Replace generator boilerplate with a real summary before shipping.
- **`getHelpSummary()` / `getHelp()` overrides make the docblock dead code.** Once a class overrides them, the docblock and the printed help are two sources of truth that disagree silently — and if `getHelp()` returns the summary verbatim, the command has no help body at all. Prefer docblocks alone; if an override exists (or you add one), delete or align the prose it shadows, and check `help <command>` prints an actual body.

## Verification Checklist

1. `ddev composer check-cs` passes
2. `ddev composer phpstan` passes
3. Tests green
4. PHPDocs complete on all new/modified code
5. `@throws` chains verified
6. Section headers present and correct
7. Imports flat alphabetical (ECS-enforced, not "PHP globals first")
8. No em-dashes (—) or en-dashes (–) in user-facing copy (`Craft::t()` strings, labels, CP notices, README, docs)
