# Craft CMS 5 — Extending (Plugins & Modules)

Reference for extending Craft CMS 5 through plugins and modules. Covers everything from elements and services to controllers, migrations, fields, and events.

This skill is scoped to **extending** Craft — building plugins, modules, custom element types, field types, and backend integrations. For site/platform development (content modeling, sections, entry types, Twig templating, plugin selection), see the `craft-site` skill.

## Companion Skills — Always Load Together

When this skill triggers, also load:

- **`craft-php-guidelines`** — PHPDoc standards, section headers, naming conventions, class organization, ECS/PHPStan, verification checklist. Required for any PHP code.
- **`ddev`** — All commands run through DDEV. Required for running ECS, PHPStan, scaffolding, and tests.
- **`craft-garnish`** — When working on CP JavaScript, asset bundles, or interactive CP components. Covers Garnish's class system, UI widgets (Modal, HUD, DisclosureMenu, Select), drag system, and the Craft.* JS class pattern.
- **`craft-pest`** — When writing, running, fixing, or reviewing tests. Covers the `markhuot/craft-pest-core` harness, database isolation (its rollback is opt-in and its env overrides are cwd-bound — both cause silent writes to the dev database), factories, HTTP/queue/DB assertions, and CI test jobs.
- **`craft-cloud`** — When the project is hosted on Craft Cloud (detect via `craft-cloud.yaml` at the repo root or `craftcms/cloud` in `composer.json`). Required for plugin Cloud-compatibility constraints — `App::isEphemeral()` guards, asset-bundle CDN publishing, 15-minute queue-job cap, `csrfInput()` function over raw token output, and the `cloud/up` deploy lifecycle events.

## Common Pitfalls (Cross-Cutting)

- Always use `addSelect()` in `beforePrepare()` — it's the Craft convention and safely additive when multiple extensions contribute columns.
- Queue workers run in primary site context — use `->site('*')` for cross-site queries.
- Including `id` in `getConfig()` — project config uses UIDs, never database IDs.
- Business logic in models or controllers — services are where logic belongs.
- Modules need manual template root, translation, and controllerNamespace registration — nothing is automatic.
- `DateTimeHelper` in elements/queries, `Carbon` in services — never mix in the same class.
- Hardcoding `/admin` in CP URLs — `cpTrigger` is configurable. Use `UrlHelper::cpUrl()` in PHP, `cpUrl()` in Twig.
- Passing `$request->getBodyParams()` directly to `savePluginSettings()` on split-settings pages — only submitted keys persist, other settings are silently dropped. Load the full settings model first, update properties, then save.
- **Naming a route or query param `token`** — it collides with Craft's reserved `tokenParam` and the request is rejected with a 400 before your controller runs. See `controllers.md` (Reserved request params).
- Any non-underscore-prefixed template in a plugin's `templates/` dir is **directly routable in the CP**, bypassing your controller's `beforeAction()` gates. Underscore-prefix every template that isn't an intentional direct route. See `cp.md` (CP template routing bypasses controllers).

## Plugin vs Module Differences

Plugins and modules share the same architecture patterns. The differences are in bootstrapping and registration:

| Feature | Plugin | Module |
|---------|--------|--------|
| CP template root | Automatic (by handle) | Manual via `EVENT_REGISTER_CP_TEMPLATE_ROOTS` |
| Site template root | Manual via event | Same — manual for both |
| Translation category | Automatic (by handle) | Manual `PhpMessageSource` in `init()` |
| Settings model | Built-in `createSettingsModel()` | Env vars, config files, or private plugin (`_` prefix) |
| Install migration | `migrations/Install.php` | Content migrations only |
| Console commands | Automatic `controllerNamespace` | Must set before `parent::init()`, must be bootstrapped |
| CP nav section | `$hasCpSection = true` | `EVENT_REGISTER_CP_NAV_ITEMS` |
| Project config | Settings auto-tracked | Manual `ProjectConfig::set()` only |
| Namespace alias | Automatic via Composer | Must call `Craft::setAlias()` |

### Module Template Root Registration

```php
use craft\events\RegisterTemplateRootsEvent;
use craft\web\View;

Event::on(View::class, View::EVENT_REGISTER_CP_TEMPLATE_ROOTS,
    function(RegisterTemplateRootsEvent $event) {
        $event->roots['my-module'] = __DIR__ . '/templates';
    }
);
```

### Module Translation Registration

```php
Craft::$app->i18n->translations['my-module'] = [
    'class' => \craft\i18n\PhpMessageSource::class,
    'sourceLanguage' => 'en',
    'basePath' => __DIR__ . '/translations',
    'allowOverrides' => true,
];
```

### Module Console Command Registration

```php
public function init()
{
    Craft::setAlias('@mymodule', __DIR__);

    if (Craft::$app->getRequest()->getIsConsoleRequest()) {
        $this->controllerNamespace = 'modules\\mymodule\\console\\controllers';
    } else {
        $this->controllerNamespace = 'modules\\mymodule\\controllers';
    }

    parent::init(); // MUST come after setting controllerNamespace
}
```

The module **must** be bootstrapped in `config/app.php` for console commands to be discoverable.
