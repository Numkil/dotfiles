## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting `muteEvents` on `ProjectConfig::set()` inside migrations -- triggers handlers that may depend on state that doesn't exist yet.
- Generating random UIDs when project config YAML already ships from dev -- check if the config path exists first.
- Non-idempotent steps -- always check column/table existence before adding.
- Using `createIndex()` / `addForeignKey()` on a code path that can run twice (notably `Install::safeUp()` under a test harness) -- MySQL accepts duplicate indexes over the same columns, so they accumulate silently until the table hits the 64-key ceiling and installs fail with `Too many keys specified`. Use `createIndexIfMissing()` and a `Db::findForeignKey()` check. See [Re-runnable index creation](#re-runnable-index-creation-and-mysqls-64-key-ceiling).
- Using `null` for FK name but specifying one for index -- use `null` for both, Craft generates deterministic names.
- Missing `TRUNCATE cache` after failed migrations on Craft Cloud -- stale mutex locks block retries. See the `craft-cloud` skill (`commands-and-cron.md`) for running the truncate via the Console command runner.
- Not thinking about ON DELETE behavior -- `CASCADE` for owned data, `SET NULL` for references, `RESTRICT` for protected refs.
- Running raw SQL without checking column/table existence first -- `addColumn` on an existing column throws, `dropColumn` on a missing one throws.
- Creating project config entries in migrations AND in YAML -- double-apply causes UID collisions or duplicate structures.
- Not wrapping data transformations in transactions -- partial updates corrupt data if the migration fails halfway through.
- Using Craft element APIs (`Entry::find()`, `Craft::$app->getElements()->saveElement()`) in *schema-phase* migrations (plugin `Install.php`/update migrations) -- the schema may not be ready yet, and element types may depend on columns/tables that don't exist until later in the migration sequence. (In a **content** migration, which runs after project config is applied, the element API is the *correct* way to set field values -- e.g. relation fields must go through `setFieldValue()` + `saveElement()`, never raw `relations` SQL. See `elements.md` → "Field value storage".)
- Flushing the whole cache from a migration (`Craft::$app->getCache()->flush()`, `clear-caches/all`) -- invalidate only what changed instead. On atomic-deploy hosts the old release is still serving live traffic against the same cache while the migration runs; a global wipe contends with it, and on Craft Cloud (where the cache falls back to a single MySQL table when Redis isn't provisioned) it can deadlock (MySQL 1205) and fail the deploy. See the `craft-cloud` skill's `deploy-pipeline.md`.
- Forgetting to handle both MySQL and PostgreSQL syntax differences -- `renameColumn()` is safe, but raw SQL (e.g. `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY COLUMN`) is MySQL-only.

## Migration Types

| Type | File / Location | Trigger | Use Case |
|------|----------------|---------|----------|
| Plugin install | `Install.php` in plugin's `migrations/` dir | `craft plugin/install` or first `craft up` after adding plugin | Create tables, seed project config, set up initial state |
| Plugin update | `m240101_000000_description.php` in plugin's `migrations/` dir | `craft up` when plugin version changes | Schema changes, data transformations between plugin versions |
| Content migration | `m240101_000000_description.php` in project root `migrations/` dir | `craft migrate/all` or `craft up` | Module-level or project-level changes -- anything not owned by a plugin |

### When to use which type

- **Plugin install migration**: One-time setup. Runs exactly once per environment when the plugin is installed. Handles table creation, foreign keys, indexes, and initial project config seeding. Has a corresponding `safeDown()` that tears everything down on uninstall.
- **Plugin update migration**: Incremental changes between versions. The plugin's `schemaVersion` in `composer.json` controls when these run -- Craft compares the installed version to the declared version and runs any new migrations.
- **Content migration**: For changes that belong to the project, not a plugin. Module schema changes, one-time data fixes, content structure modifications. Created with `ddev craft migrate/create my_migration_name`. These share a single global track.

## Scaffold

```bash
ddev craft make migration --with-docblocks
```

The `Install.php` migration runs on plugin install. Numbered migrations run on `ddev craft up`.

**Modules** don't have `Install.php` -- use content migrations created with `ddev craft migrate/create my_migration_name`. These go in the project's `migrations/` directory and share a global track.

**Schema-change discipline.** Every change to plugin schema must land in BOTH `Install.php` (canonical fresh shape) AND a dated migration (idempotent upgrade path). The two failure directions are symmetric:

- Editing only `Install.php` leaves existing installs — including your `db_test` after the first test run — on the prior schema. See the `craft-pest` skill's `shared-state.md` → "Schema drift: `Install.php` vs migrations in the test database".
- Editing only the dated migration leaves **fresh installs** without the change: on plugin install, Craft runs `Install.php` and then **marks every dated migration as applied without running it**. Anything a dated migration does that `Install.php` doesn't (a column, an index, a data seed) simply never happens on a new install — and nothing errors, because the migration is recorded as done.

## Safety Rules

### 1. Always Mute Events in Migrations

```php
Craft::$app->getProjectConfig()->muteEvents = true;
Craft::$app->getProjectConfig()->set($path, $data);
Craft::$app->getProjectConfig()->muteEvents = false;
```

### 2. Every Step Must Be Idempotent

```php
if (!$this->db->columnExists(Table::MY_ELEMENTS, 'categoryId')) {
    $this->addColumn(Table::MY_ELEMENTS, 'categoryId', $this->integer()->after('id'));
}
```

### 3. Check Before Generating UIDs

```php
$existingConfig = Craft::$app->getProjectConfig()->get($path);
if ($existingConfig !== null) {
    return; // Already seeded from YAML
}
```

## Table Creation

```php
$this->createTable(Table::MY_ELEMENTS, [
    'id' => $this->integer()->notNull(),
    'externalId' => $this->string()->notNull(),
    'categoryId' => $this->integer()->notNull(),
    'postDate' => $this->dateTime(),
    'expiryDate' => $this->dateTime(),
    'dateCreated' => $this->dateTime()->notNull(),
    'dateUpdated' => $this->dateTime()->notNull(),
    'uid' => $this->uid(),
    'PRIMARY KEY(id)',
]);
```

## Foreign Keys

```php
// Element table -> elements.id with CASCADE delete
$this->addForeignKey(null, Table::MY_ELEMENTS, ['id'], CraftTable::ELEMENTS, ['id'], 'CASCADE', null);

// Reference to config table -- SET NULL on delete
$this->addForeignKey(null, Table::MY_ELEMENTS, ['categoryId'], Table::CATEGORIES, ['id'], 'SET NULL', null);
```

Use `null` for the FK name -- Craft generates a deterministic name. Always decide: `CASCADE` for owned data, `SET NULL` for references, `RESTRICT` for protected references.

There is no `addForeignKeyIfMissing()`. When a migration (or an `Install.php`) can run more than once against the same database, check first:

```php
use craft\helpers\Db;

// Db::findForeignKey() returns the existing constraint name, or null.
if (Db::findForeignKey(Table::MY_ELEMENTS, 'categoryId') === null) {
    $this->addForeignKey(null, Table::MY_ELEMENTS, ['categoryId'], Table::CATEGORIES, ['id'], 'SET NULL', null);
}
```

## Indexes

```php
// Compound unique for external ID scoping
$this->createIndex(null, Table::MY_ELEMENTS, ['categoryId', 'externalId'], true);

// Performance indexes
$this->createIndex(null, Table::MY_ELEMENTS, ['postDate']);
$this->createIndex(null, Table::MY_ELEMENTS, ['expiryDate']);
```

### Re-runnable index creation, and MySQL's 64-key ceiling

`createIndex()` is **not** idempotent, and MySQL will not stop you: it accepts any number of indexes over the same columns as long as the names differ, and `null` names are generated per call. So a migration path that executes twice adds a second index; ten times adds ten.

Nothing fails while this happens — until the table reaches **MySQL's hard limit of 64 keys per table**, at which point the next `createIndex()` (or `addForeignKey()`, since each FK carries an index) aborts with `Too many keys specified; max 64 keys allowed`. The error names the index that finally crossed the line, not the duplicate accumulation that consumed the budget, so it reads as a spurious failure on a line that has always worked.

Use Craft's guarded variant, which delegates to `Db::findIndex()` and skips when an equivalent index already exists:

```php
$this->createIndexIfMissing(Table::MY_ELEMENTS, ['handle'], true);
$this->createIndexIfMissing(Table::MY_ELEMENTS, ['categoryId']);
```

`craft\db\Migration::createIndexIfMissing(string $table, array|string $columns, bool $unique = false)` — verified against `craftcms/cms` 5.10.11. Note the signature takes no name argument; matching is by columns and uniqueness.

**Where the double-execution comes from.** Normal `craft up` runs each numbered migration once (tracked in the `migrations` table), so this rarely bites production. The two paths that do re-run:

- **`Install.php`** — re-invoked whenever plugin-install detection misses, which is routine in a standalone test harness that boots a fresh process per run. Guard `Install::safeUp()` exactly as above.
- **Manual re-application** — someone reruns a migration after clearing its history row, or a botched deploy replays one.

Diagnosing an existing table: `SHOW INDEX FROM myplugin_items` (or `$schema->getTableIndexes()`), and look for several differently-named indexes over identical columns. The test-harness angle and a regression test that asserts index/FK counts stay flat across two `safeUp()` calls are in the **`craft-pest`** skill's `shared-state.md` → "Plugin `Install` migrations must be idempotent".

## Common Schema Patterns

### Adding columns (with idempotency)

```php
if (!$this->db->columnExists('{{%my_table}}', 'newColumn')) {
    $this->addColumn('{{%my_table}}', 'newColumn', $this->string()->after('existingColumn'));
}
```

Always check `columnExists()` first. Without this guard, re-running a migration (e.g., after a failed batch) throws a "column already exists" exception.

### Renaming columns

```php
$this->renameColumn('{{%my_table}}', 'oldName', 'newName');
```

Craft's `renameColumn()` is database-agnostic -- it generates the correct SQL for both MySQL and PostgreSQL. Do NOT use raw `ALTER TABLE ... CHANGE COLUMN` SQL, which is MySQL-only.

### Changing column types

```php
$this->alterColumn('{{%my_table}}', 'myColumn', $this->text());
```

Be careful with type changes that lose data -- `text` to `string(255)` truncates long values. For large tables, `ALTER` locks the table for its duration.

### Data transformations

```php
$transaction = Craft::$app->getDb()->beginTransaction();
try {
    $this->update('{{%my_table}}', ['status' => 'active'], ['status' => 'enabled']);
    $transaction->commit();
} catch (\Throwable $e) {
    $transaction->rollBack();
    throw $e;
}
```

Always wrap data transformations in transactions. Partial updates from a failed migration corrupt data.

### Dropping columns and tables safely

```php
if ($this->db->columnExists('{{%my_table}}', 'deprecatedColumn')) {
    $this->dropColumn('{{%my_table}}', 'deprecatedColumn');
}

$this->dropTableIfExists('{{%my_table}}');
```

`dropTableIfExists()` is built into Craft's migration base class -- preferred over checking `tableExists()` then calling `dropTable()`.

### Dropping indexes and foreign keys

```php
// Drop index by generated name
$indexName = $this->db->getIndexName('{{%my_table}}', ['columnA', 'columnB']);
$this->dropIndex($indexName, '{{%my_table}}');

// Drop foreign key by generated name
$fkName = $this->db->getForeignKeyName('{{%my_table}}', ['parentId']);
$this->dropForeignKey($fkName, '{{%my_table}}');
```

## Content Migrations -- Creating Sections, Fields, Entry Types

Use these service-layer calls for **any** programmatic schema authoring — migrations, setup scripts, or AI/MCP tools — not just migrations. Craft validates, assigns UIDs, and writes the project-config YAML for you; don't hand-write YAML and `project-config/apply` to author schema (that's for deploys), and remember runtime writes are refused when `allowAdminChanges` is off. See the `craft-content-modeling` skill's `infrastructure.md` → "Authoring schema from code".

### Creating a section

```php
use craft\models\Section;
use craft\models\Section_SiteSettings;

$section = new Section([
    'name' => 'News',
    'handle' => 'news',
    'type' => Section::TYPE_CHANNEL,
    'siteSettings' => array_map(
        fn($site) => new Section_SiteSettings([
            'siteId' => $site->id,
            'hasUrls' => true,
            'uriFormat' => 'news/{slug}',
            'template' => 'news/_entry',
            'enabledByDefault' => true,
        ]),
        Craft::$app->getSites()->getAllSites(),
    ),
]);

if (!Craft::$app->getEntries()->saveSection($section)) {
    throw new \RuntimeException('Could not save section: ' . implode(', ', $section->getFirstErrors()));
}
```

### Creating a field

```php
use craft\fields\PlainText;

$field = new PlainText([
    'groupId' => Craft::$app->getFields()->getAllGroups()[0]->id,
    'name' => 'Subtitle',
    'handle' => 'subtitle',
    'translationMethod' => 'none',
]);

if (!Craft::$app->getFields()->saveField($field)) {
    throw new \RuntimeException('Could not save field: ' . implode(', ', $field->getFirstErrors()));
}
```

### Assigning fields to a field layout

```php
use craft\fieldlayoutelements\CustomField;
use craft\models\FieldLayout;
use craft\models\FieldLayoutTab;

$fieldLayout = new FieldLayout();
$fieldLayout->setTabs([
    new FieldLayoutTab([
        'name' => 'Content',
        'elements' => [
            ['type' => craft\fieldlayoutelements\entries\EntryTitleField::class],
            ['type' => CustomField::class, 'fieldUid' => $field->uid],
        ],
    ]),
]);

$section->setFieldLayout($fieldLayout);
Craft::$app->getEntries()->saveSection($section);
```

### Creating entry types

In Craft 5, sections and entry types are decoupled. A section can have multiple entry types, each with its own field layout:

```php
use craft\models\EntryType;

$entryType = new EntryType();
$entryType->name = 'Document';
$entryType->handle = 'document';
$entryType->icon = 'file-lines';
$entryType->color = 'blue';

// Assign field layout to the entry type, not the section
$entryType->setFieldLayout($fieldLayout);

if (!Craft::$app->getEntries()->saveEntryType($entryType)) {
    throw new \RuntimeException('Could not save entry type: ' . implode(', ', $entryType->getFirstErrors()));
}

// Assign entry type to the section
$section->setEntryTypes([$entryType->id]);
Craft::$app->getEntries()->saveSection($section);
```

### Warning: project config coordination

Content migrations that create sections, fields, or entry types write to project config. If your project also has YAML files in `config/project/` that define the same structures, you get a conflict. The rule:

- **In dev**: Create structures via the CP (with `allowAdminChanges` on), then export as YAML. Migrations are for data transformations only.
- **In CI/automated setups**: If you create structures programmatically, do NOT also ship YAML for those same structures. One source of truth.
- **On environments where `allowAdminChanges` is off (production, Craft Cloud)**: don't build project-config-managed schema (sections, fields, entry types, field layouts) imperatively in a migration at all. Build it locally with admin changes on, let project config capture it to YAML, and let `project-config/apply` create it deterministically with matching UIDs. Imperative schema in a migration risks UID divergence against the committed YAML and double-applies. Reserve migrations for what project config can't hold — data transformations, and content (Formie forms, entries) seeded in a *content* migration after YAML is applied.
- **`craft up`** runs plugin/Craft migrations, then applies project config YAML, then content migrations (see [Execution order in `craft up`](#execution-order-in-craft-up)). If a migration and the YAML both create the same section, the apply step fails or creates duplicates.

## Multi-Site Migrations

### Iterating all sites

```php
$sites = Craft::$app->getSites()->getAllSites();

foreach ($sites as $site) {
    $this->update(
        '{{%content}}',
        ['field_subtitle' => 'Default subtitle'],
        ['siteId' => $site->id, 'field_subtitle' => null],
    );
}
```

### Propagating content across sites

When adding a new site, existing entries may need content populated. Query rows from the primary site and insert for the new site, checking existence first to avoid duplicates. Use `Craft::$app->getSites()->getPrimarySite()` for the source and `getSiteByHandle()` for the target.

### Site-specific data transformations

```php
$site = Craft::$app->getSites()->getSiteByHandle('de');

if ($site) {
    $this->update(
        '{{%my_table}}',
        ['locale' => 'de_DE'],
        ['siteId' => $site->id],
    );
}
```

Always null-check the site -- it may not exist in every environment (e.g., a staging environment with fewer sites than production).

## Project Config Interaction

### When to use project config vs direct DB writes

| Scenario | Approach | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Creating sections, fields, entry types | Project config (via service APIs) | These are config-managed -- direct DB writes get overwritten by `craft up` |
| Adding custom plugin tables/columns | Direct DB writes (`addColumn`, `createTable`) | Custom tables are not project config managed |
| Data transformations (UPDATE rows) | Direct DB writes | Data is not config -- project config only tracks structure |
| Setting relation/custom **field values** | Element API (`setFieldValue` + `saveElement`) in a *content* migration | Field values live in `elements_sites.content` (JSON, keyed by layout-element UID); raw `relations`/`content` SQL does **not** update the rendered value. See the `craftcms` skill's `elements.md` → "Field value storage". |
| Seeding plugin settings | Project config with `muteEvents` | Settings sync across environments via YAML |

### The muteEvents pattern

When writing to project config inside a migration, always mute events. Without this, project config handlers fire immediately, potentially depending on database state that doesn't exist yet. See [Safety Rules](#safety-rules) for the code pattern.

### Never call `ProjectConfig::flush()` inside a migration

Two independent reasons:

- `flush()` calls `saveModifiedConfigData()`, which **releases the shared project-config mutex when it finishes** (`craftcms/cms` 5.10.12, `src/services/ProjectConfig.php:873`) — including a lock the surrounding process (Craft's own migration apply, a test harness) acquired and still believes it holds. The lock state is desynced for the rest of the process; later project-config writes then fail with `BusyResourceException`/`StaleResourceException` in places far from the migration that caused it.
- With automatic YAML writing enabled, `flush()` rewrites `config/project/*.yaml` — files the developer has **committed to VCS**. A plugin upgrade that mutates a project's tracked YAML out from under its owner is wrong on its own terms, independent of the lock problem.

If a plugin stored a bad settings value that needs correcting, coerce it **at read time** (in the settings model or a getter) rather than rewriting stored config from a migration.

### Execution order in `craft up`

`craft up` is not "migrations, then project config" — the content track runs *last*, after project config has been applied. The precise sequence, from `craftcms/cms` `UpController::actionIndex()`:

1. **`migrate/all --no-content`** — Craft + plugin migrations. The content track is deliberately excluded here.
2. **Save / reset modified project config data** (`saveModifiedConfigData()` + `reset()`).
3. **`project-config/apply`** — applies pending YAML changes (diffed against the database), if any.
4. **`migrate/up --track=content`** — content migrations (project root `migrations/`).
5. **`clear-caches/compiled-templates`**.
6. **Write YAML files** — conditional, only if automatic YAML writing is enabled and config isn't read-only.

The ordering has a practical consequence:

- **Content migrations (step 4) can rely on YAML-defined schema already existing** — sections, fields, and entry types from `config/project/` have been applied in step 3. This is the right place to seed entries, Formie forms, or other content that depends on the schema.
- **Plugin and Craft migrations (step 1) cannot** — they run before project config is applied. Don't reference YAML-defined sections/fields from a plugin migration.

If your migration creates a section and the YAML also defines that section, the apply step conflicts. Rule of thumb: **let one system own each piece of config**. Migrations own data transformations. YAML owns structural config.

## safeDown() and Rollback Patterns

### Reversible schema changes

Schema changes (adding/dropping columns, tables, indexes) can typically be reversed:

```php
public function safeDown(): bool
{
    $this->dropTableIfExists('{{%my_table}}');
    // or: $this->dropColumn('{{%my_table}}', 'newColumn');
    return true;
}
```

### Non-reversible migrations

Data transformations (UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT) are generally not reversible. You can't un-transform data without storing the original values somewhere. For these, return `false`:

```php
public function safeDown(): bool|false
{
    // Data transformation is not reversible -- original values are lost.
    return false;
}
```

Returning `false` tells Craft this migration cannot be rolled back. `craft migrate/down` will refuse to undo it.

### Mixed migrations

If a migration has both schema changes and data transformations, the data transformation makes the whole migration non-reversible. Either return `false` from `safeDown()`, or reverse only the schema portions and document clearly that data changes are not restored.

## Migration Ordering

### Timestamp format

Migrations are named `m{YYMMDD}_{HHMMSS}_description.php` and execute in timestamp order. The timestamp is the creation time, not the intended execution time.

### Track isolation

Each plugin has its own migration track, triggered when the plugin's `schemaVersion` changes. Plugin A's migrations never block Plugin B's. Content migrations (project root `migrations/`) have their own track, independent of all plugin tracks.

### Modules and library-shipped modules have no CLI track

`craft migrate/up --track=module:<handle>` fails with `Invalid migration track` — `MigrateController` resolves only `craft`, `content`, and `plugin:<handle>` (plus an `EVENT_REGISTER_MIGRATOR` escape hatch nothing registers for you; `craftcms/cms` 5.10.12, `src/console/controllers/MigrateController.php:467`). A project-level module uses content migrations instead (see above). A module shipped **inside a Composer library** is worse: its migrations run only when a consumer plugin calls the module's own migrator from a dated migration of its own —

```php
// In the consumer plugin's dated migration
\acme\kit\Kit::getInstance()->getMigrator()->up();
```

— and that consumer must also bump its own `schemaVersion`, or the dated migration never runs. Bumping the library's version constraint alone applies nothing. See the `craft-plugin-release` skill for the release-ordering hazards this creates.

### Running all tracks

| Command | Tracks |
|---------|--------|
| `craft up` | All plugin tracks + content track + project config |
| `craft migrate/all` | All plugin tracks + content track (no project config) |
| `craft migrate/up` | Content track only |
| `craft migrate/up --track=plugin:my-plugin` | Specific plugin track only |

## craft migrate vs craft up

| Command | Runs Migrations | Applies Project Config | Use When |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|----------|
| `craft up` | Yes (all tracks) | Yes | Deployment -- the standard deploy command |
| `craft migrate/all` | Yes (all tracks) | No | Need migrations without project config changes |
| `craft migrate/up` | Yes (content track only) | No | Running only content migrations |
| `craft migrate/down` | Rolls back last migration (content track) | No | Undoing a content migration in development |

`craft up` is the correct command for deployments. It runs Craft + plugin migrations, applies project config YAML, then runs content migrations last (see [Execution order in `craft up`](#execution-order-in-craft-up) for the exact sequence). Running `craft migrate/all` alone in a deploy script means project config changes from other developers never get applied.

## Deployment

These apply to every Craft deployment -- Craft Cloud, Servd, Forge, bare metal, or any CI/CD pipeline. (On Craft Cloud specifically, migrations run automatically during the Migrate phase via `php craft cloud/up` — see the `craft-cloud` skill's `deploy-pipeline.md` for the full sequence.)

- Always run `ddev craft up` locally before deploying -- this runs pending migrations and applies project config changes in one command.
- Migrations should run before the application serves traffic. Most hosting platforms and CI/CD pipelines handle this as a separate deploy step.
- Failed migrations can leave mutex locks in the `cache` table -- `TRUNCATE cache` to recover.
- `craft clear-caches/all` after deployment if caches aren't automatically invalidated by your hosting platform.
- The project config YAML files in `config/project/` are the source of truth for configuration. Never edit the `projectConfig` database table directly.
