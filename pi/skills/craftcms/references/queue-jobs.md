## Common Pitfalls

- Naming jobs with a "Job" suffix — Craft convention has no suffix: `ResaveElements`, not `ResaveElementsJob`.
- Missing `site('*')` on element queries — queue workers run in primary site context, elements on non-primary sites are invisible.
- Forgetting `->status(null)` — disabled/expired elements are filtered out by default.
- Not overriding `getTtr()` for long-running jobs — default is 300s (5 min). Exceeding TTR causes re-reservation and duplicate execution.
- Using `$this->setProgress()` with wrong math — denominator must be total items, not current index.
- Forgetting `App::maxPowerCaptain()` — Craft calls this automatically, but custom long operations within a job may still hit limits.
- Using `runQueueAutomatically` on high-traffic production sites — the web runner blocks PHP-FPM workers. Use `craft queue/listen` instead.
- Accessing `Craft::$app->getUser()` in queue jobs — no user session in queue context. Pass needed user IDs as job properties.
- Not reporting progress in long-running jobs — CP shows a "stuck" indicator, admins retry thinking it failed.
- Memory leaks in batch operations — element caches grow unbounded. Use `Db::each()` or paginated queries.
- Rethrowing from a "best-effort" helper inside `processItem()` — causes `BaseBatchedJob` to retry the item. For non-idempotent operations (HTTP forward, email send), this produces duplicate side effects. Best-effort means log and return, not log and rethrow.
- Removing `@property` docblock hints for queue-injected properties — the queue runner dynamically assigns `$this->queue` to job instances. Without a `@property Queue $queue` annotation on the class docblock, PHPStan reports an undefined property error. This applies to `BaseJob`, `BaseBatchedJob`, and any custom base job class. Always keep `@property` hints for properties that are injected by the framework rather than declared in the class body.
- Overriding `getDescription()` on `BaseBatchedJob` — fatal error: "Cannot override final method." The extension point is `defaultDescription()`, not `getDescription()`. Same pattern applies to `BaseJob`. See [BaseBatchedJob Subclass Contract](#basebatchedjob-subclass-contract) below.
- Assuming User element properties are fully populated in queue jobs — `UserQuery::beforePrepare()` excludes security-sensitive columns (`lastPasswordChangeDate`, `password`, `invalidLoginCount`, `verificationCode`, and others). These return `null` even when the DB has values. In queue context this is especially deceptive because there's no browser session to hint at the problem. Query `Table::USERS` directly for excluded columns. See `elements.md` Common Pitfalls for the full list and workaround.

## Scaffold

```bash
ddev craft make queue-job --with-docblocks
```

## Job Pattern

```php
class SyncItems extends BaseJob
{
    public int $categoryId;
    public ?int $siteId = null;

    public function execute($queue): void
    {
        $items = $this->_fetchItems();
        $total = count($items);

        foreach ($items as $i => $item) {
            $this->setProgress($queue, ($i + 1) / $total, "Processing {$item->title}");
            $this->_processItem($item);
        }
    }

    protected function defaultDescription(): ?string
    {
        return Craft::t('my-plugin', 'Syncing items for category {id}', [
            'id' => $this->categoryId,
        ]);
    }
}
```

## Critical: Site Context in Workers

Queue workers run in primary site context. Elements on non-primary sites are invisible:

```php
// BAD: misses elements on non-primary sites
$element = MyElement::find()->externalId($id)->one();

// GOOD: always use site('*') and status(null) in queue workers
$element = MyElement::find()
    ->site('*')
    ->externalId($id)
    ->categoryId($this->categoryId)
    ->status(null)
    ->one();
```

## TTR (Time-To-Reserve)

Override for long-running jobs. Default is 300s. Exceeding TTR causes re-reservation (duplicate execution). Set to at least 2x expected duration. Per-job `getTtr()` overrides the global `ttr` in `config/app.php`.

```php
public function getTtr(): int
{
    return 600; // 10 minutes
}
```

## Queue Infrastructure

### Web runner vs daemon

| Method | Config | When to use |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Web runner | `runQueueAutomatically => true` (default) | Development, low-traffic sites |
| Daemon | `craft queue/listen` | Production, high-traffic, long-running jobs |

The web runner piggybacks on HTTP requests — PHP stays alive after page delivery to process jobs. This blocks a PHP-FPM worker for the job's duration. On high-traffic sites, this exhausts the worker pool. Disable in `config/general.php` with `'runQueueAutomatically' => false`.

### Console commands

```bash
ddev craft queue/run                  # Process all pending jobs and exit
ddev craft queue/listen               # Long-running daemon (restarts after each job)
ddev craft queue/listen --verbose     # Daemon with logging (recommended for production)
```

In production, run `craft queue/listen` under a process supervisor (systemd, Supervisor). For DDEV, a terminal tab is sufficient.

## Pushing to Queue

```php
// Standard push
Craft::$app->getQueue()->push(new SyncItems([
    'categoryId' => $category->id,
]));

// With delay (seconds)
Craft::$app->getQueue()->delay(60)->push(new SyncItems([
    'categoryId' => $category->id,
]));

// With priority (lower = higher priority)
Craft::$app->getQueue()->priority(1024)->push(new SyncItems([
    'categoryId' => $category->id,
]));

```

## Job Priority

Lower number = higher priority. Default is 1024. Methods chain: `->delay(30)->priority(100)->push(...)`.

| Priority | Use case |
|----------|----------|
| 100 | User-triggered actions (exports, imports the user is waiting for) |
| 1024 | Default — standard background tasks |
| 2048 | Background maintenance (cleanup, stats aggregation) |
| 4096 | Low-priority bulk operations (re-indexing, cache warming) |

`delay(N)` postpones execution by N seconds. Useful for rate limiting or debouncing rapid saves.

## Retry Strategies

### Basic retry

```php
public function canRetry($attempt, $error): bool
{
    return $attempt < 3;
}
```

### Selective retry by error type

Retry network/server errors, fail immediately on client errors and application-level validation errors:

```php
public function canRetry($attempt, $error): bool
{
    if ($attempt >= 5) { return false; }

    // Network errors — retry
    if ($error instanceof \GuzzleHttp\Exception\ConnectException) { return true; }
    if ($error instanceof \GuzzleHttp\Exception\ServerException) { return true; }

    // Client errors (4xx) — don't retry, the request is wrong
    if ($error instanceof \GuzzleHttp\Exception\ClientException) { return false; }

    // Application-level validation — don't retry, the data is bad
    if ($error instanceof \craft\errors\ElementNotFoundException) { return false; }
    if ($error instanceof \yii\base\InvalidArgumentException) { return false; }

    // Unknown errors — retry cautiously
    return true;
}
```

The key principle: retry transient failures (network timeouts, 503s), never retry permanent failures (bad data, missing elements, 404s). If `saveElement()` throws because validation failed, retrying won't fix the data.

### Global max attempts

In `config/app.php` (default: 1). Per-job `canRetry()` takes precedence when defined:

```php
'queue' => ['attempts' => 3],
```

### Manual exponential backoff

No built-in exponential backoff. Pattern: add a custom `$attempt` property, catch errors, re-push with increasing delay:

```php
public int $attempt = 0; // Custom property — not built-in

public function execute($queue): void
{
    try {
        $this->_doWork();
    } catch (\GuzzleHttp\Exception\ServerException $e) {
        if ($this->attempt < 5) {
            $delay = (int)(30 * pow(2, $this->attempt)); // 30s, 60s, 120s...
            Craft::$app->getQueue()->delay($delay)->push(new self([
                'categoryId' => $this->categoryId, 'attempt' => $this->attempt + 1,
            ]));
            return;
        }
        throw $e;
    }
}
```

## Best-Effort Helpers in Queue Jobs

When a private method inside `processItem()` or `execute()` is documented as "best-effort" (e.g., recording an outcome, updating a cursor, writing an audit log), its catch block must log and return — not rethrow:

```php
// Correct — best-effort: logs failure, does not rethrow
private function _recordRowOutcome(int $rowId, string $status): void
{
    try {
        Db::update('{{%my_outcomes}}', ['status' => $status], ['rowId' => $rowId]);
    } catch (\Throwable $e) {
        Craft::error("Failed to record outcome for row {$rowId}: {$e->getMessage()}", 'my-plugin');
        return; // best-effort — the primary operation already succeeded
    }
}

// Wrong — docblock says "never rethrown" but catch rethrows
private function _recordRowOutcome(int $rowId, string $status): void
{
    try {
        Db::update('{{%my_outcomes}}', ['status' => $status], ['rowId' => $rowId]);
    } catch (\Throwable $e) {
        Craft::error($e->getMessage(), 'my-plugin');
        throw new \RuntimeException("..."); // contradicts "best-effort" contract
    }
}
```

Rethrowing from a best-effort helper causes `BaseBatchedJob` to mark the item failed and retry it. For non-idempotent operations (HTTP forward, email send, webhook dispatch), retry produces duplicate side effects — the primary operation already succeeded, only the bookkeeping failed.

When rethrowable failure IS the intended behavior, the docblock must say so: "Throws on transport failure — caller handles retry." The default contract for private helpers called from `processItem()` is best-effort unless documented otherwise.

## Failed Job Handling

When `canRetry()` returns `false` or max attempts are exceeded, the job is marked as failed in the `queue` table.

```bash
ddev craft queue/info       # Pending, reserved, done, failed counts
ddev craft queue/retry      # Retry all failed jobs
ddev craft queue/release    # Release stuck/reserved jobs
```

To investigate, query the `queue` table: `SELECT id, description, error FROM queue WHERE fail = 1 ORDER BY timePushed DESC LIMIT 20;`. The CP queue manager (gear icon, bottom-left) also shows failed jobs with a retry button.

## Long-Running Job Patterns

### Progress reporting

Always report progress in jobs taking more than a few seconds. Include a meaningful message — users see this in the CP:

```php
$this->setProgress($queue, ($i + 1) / $total, "Processing {$entry->title} (" . ($i + 1) . " of {$total})");
```

### Memory management

Element queries cache results. Over thousands of iterations, memory grows unbounded. Use `Db::each()` for memory-safe iteration:

```php
use craft\helpers\Db;

$query = Entry::find()->section('products')->site('*')->status(null);
foreach (Db::each($query) as $i => $entry) {
    $this->setProgress($queue, $i / $query->count());
    $this->_processEntry($entry);
}
```

For very large datasets, paginate and call `gc_collect_cycles()` between batches:

```php
for ($offset = 0; $offset < $query->count(); $offset += 100) {
    $entries = (clone $query)->offset($offset)->limit(100)->all();
    foreach ($entries as $entry) { $this->_processEntry($entry); }
    gc_collect_cycles();
}
```

For parent jobs that spawn child operations, use `craft\queue\BaseBatchedJob` for automatic memory monitoring and configurable `$batchSize`.

### BaseBatchedJob Subclass Contract

`BaseBatchedJob` has `final` methods that cannot be overridden. Read the parent class before assuming any method is overridable — this pattern applies to other Craft base classes too.

| Method | Overridable | Purpose |
|--------|:-----------:|---------|
| `loadData()` | Yes (abstract) | Return a `Batchable` (query or collection) of items to process |
| `processItem(mixed $item)` | Yes (abstract) | Handle a single item from the batch |
| `beforeBatch()` | Yes | Hook before processing starts |
| `afterBatch()` | Yes | Hook after processing completes |
| `defaultDescription()` | Yes | Return the job's display name for the CP queue monitor |
| `getTtr()` | Yes | Time-to-reserve override |
| `canRetry($attempt, $error)` | Yes | Retry logic override |
| `getDescription()` | **No (final)** | Reads from `$this->description ?? $this->defaultDescription()`. Override `defaultDescription()` instead. |
| `execute($queue)` | **No (final)** | Contains the batch loop, memory monitoring, and progress reporting. Override `processItem()` for per-item logic. |

```php
use craft\queue\BaseBatchedJob;

class SyncExternalProducts extends BaseBatchedJob
{
    /**
     * @inheritdoc
     */
    protected function defaultDescription(): ?string
    {
        return Craft::t('my-plugin', 'Syncing external products');
    }

    /**
     * @inheritdoc
     */
    protected function loadData(): Batchable
    {
        return Entry::find()->section('products')->status(null)->site('*');
    }

    /**
     * @inheritdoc
     */
    protected function processItem(mixed $item): void
    {
        /** @var Entry $item */
        // Sync single product entry with external API
    }
}
```

## Common Queue Job Patterns

### Resave elements

Use Craft's built-in job instead of writing a custom one:

```php
use craft\queue\jobs\ResaveElements;

Craft::$app->getQueue()->push(new ResaveElements([
    'elementType' => Entry::class,
    'criteria' => ['section' => 'products', 'site' => '*', 'status' => null],
]));
```

### Sync external data

Fetch from API, upsert elements. Key points: high TTR, retry only on network errors, `site('*')` + `status(null)`:

```php
class SyncProducts extends BaseJob
{
    public function execute($queue): void
    {
        $client = Craft::createGuzzleClient();
        $products = json_decode(
            $client->get('https://api.example.com/products')->getBody()->getContents(), true
        );
        foreach ($products as $i => $data) {
            $this->setProgress($queue, ($i + 1) / count($products));
            $entry = Entry::find()->section('products')->site('*')->status(null)
                ->externalId($data['id'])->one() ?? new Entry();
            $entry->sectionId = Craft::$app->getEntries()->getSectionByHandle('products')->id;
            $entry->title = $data['name'];
            Craft::$app->getElements()->saveElement($entry);
        }
    }
    public function getTtr(): int { return 900; }
    public function canRetry($attempt, $error): bool
    {
        return $attempt < 3 && $error instanceof \GuzzleHttp\Exception\ConnectException;
    }
    protected function defaultDescription(): ?string
    {
        return Craft::t('my-plugin', 'Syncing products');
    }
}
```

### Send notification emails

Push from controller, send in job. Never send email synchronously in web requests. Pass IDs as properties since there is no user session in queue context:

```php
class SendOrderConfirmation extends BaseJob
{
    public int $orderId;
    public string $recipientEmail;

    public function execute($queue): void
    {
        $order = Entry::find()->section('orders')->id($this->orderId)
            ->site('*')->status(null)->one();
        if (!$order) { return; }
        Craft::$app->getMailer()
            ->composeFromKey('order-confirmation', ['order' => $order])
            ->setTo($this->recipientEmail)->send();
    }
    protected function defaultDescription(): ?string
    {
        return Craft::t('my-plugin', 'Sending order confirmation');
    }
}
```

### Generate exports

Write to temp file, email as attachment:

```php
class GenerateCsvExport extends BaseJob
{
    public int $userId;
    public string $section;

    public function execute($queue): void
    {
        $entries = Entry::find()->section($this->section)->site('*')->status(null)->all();
        $tempPath = Craft::$app->getPath()->getTempPath() . '/export-' . time() . '.csv';
        $fp = fopen($tempPath, 'w');
        fputcsv($fp, ['Title', 'Status']);
        foreach ($entries as $i => $entry) {
            $this->setProgress($queue, ($i + 1) / count($entries));
            fputcsv($fp, [$entry->title, $entry->status]);
        }
        fclose($fp);

        $user = Craft::$app->getUsers()->getUserById($this->userId);
        if ($user) {
            Craft::$app->getMailer()->compose()
                ->setTo($user->email)->setSubject('Export ready')->attach($tempPath)->send();
        }
        unlink($tempPath);
    }
    protected function defaultDescription(): ?string
    {
        return Craft::t('my-plugin', 'Generating CSV export');
    }
}
```

## Built-in Queue Jobs

Craft uses these internally. Push them directly instead of writing custom equivalents:

| Job Class | When Craft Uses It |
|-----------|--------------------|
| `ResaveElements` | After bulk operations, field layout changes |
| `UpdateSearchIndex` | After element saves |
| `GenerateImageTransform` | When `generateTransformsBeforePageLoad` is false |
| `ApplyNewPropagationMethod` | After changing section propagation method |
| `PruneRevisions` | When `maxRevisions` config is lowered |
| `FindAndReplace` | CP Utilities > Find and Replace |
| `LocalizeRelations` | After changing a relational field to per-site |
| `PropagateElements` | After enabling a section for additional sites |

All live in the `craft\queue\jobs` namespace.

## Queue Health Monitoring

```bash
ddev craft queue/info       # Shows waiting, delayed, reserved, done, failed counts
ddev craft queue/release    # Release stuck/reserved jobs (worker crashed mid-job)
```

A job is "stuck" when reserved for longer than its TTR but not released — typically means the worker process crashed. Signs: `reserved` count stays non-zero, CP shows spinning with no progress.

The CP queue manager (gear icon, bottom-left) shows pending/failed counts, a progress bar for running jobs, and a retry button for failures.

For DDEV development: `ddev craft queue/listen --verbose` to watch jobs in real-time, or `ddev craft queue/run --verbose` to process all pending and exit.
