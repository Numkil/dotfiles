# DDEV for Craft CMS Development

## Companion Skills — Always Load Together

When this skill triggers, also load:

- **`craftcms`** — Plugin/module development. Required when DDEV commands involve Craft CLI (`ddev craft make`, `ddev craft migrate`, `ddev craft project-config`).
- **`craft-php-guidelines`** — PHP coding standards. Required when DDEV commands involve code quality tooling (`ddev composer check-cs`, `ddev composer phpstan`, `ddev craft pest/test`).

## Documentation

When unsure about a DDEV feature, `WebFetch` the relevant docs page.

## Common Pitfalls

- Using `ddev exec composer install` instead of `ddev composer install` — DDEV shorthand commands handle path resolution and environment setup. Always use the shorthand.
- Forgetting `ddev craft up` does both `migrate/all` and `project-config/apply` — no need to run them separately after pulls or deploys.
- Exposing the Vite dev server with `ports` instead of `web_extra_exposed_ports` — `ports` causes conflicts when running multiple DDEV projects. `web_extra_exposed_ports` routes through Traefik and works with HTTPS.
- Running `ddev composer global require` — global packages install inside the container and vanish on restart. Install project-level dependencies only.
- Setting `nodejs_version` but running `npm install` on the host — Node must run inside the container via `ddev npm` to match the configured version.
- Editing `.ddev/config.yaml` while containers are running without restarting — changes to config require `ddev restart` to take effect.
- Using `ddev import-db` without `--target-db=db` on multi-database setups — the default target is `db`, but if you've configured additional databases, be explicit.
- Adding `#ddev-generated` to custom commands you've customized — DDEV overwrites files with this comment during updates. Only use it for add-on-managed commands. Custom commands you maintain should omit it.
- Running `composer install` on the host then `ddev composer check-cs`/`ddev composer phpstan` — if the host PHP version differs from DDEV's (e.g., host PHP 8.4, DDEV PHP 8.3), `vendor/composer/platform_check.php` fails. Always run `ddev composer install` so `vendor/` matches the container's PHP version.

## Craft CLI First, Raw SQL Last

Always prefer Craft CLI commands over raw database queries:

```bash
ddev craft users/list-admins         # not: ddev mysql -e "SELECT * FROM users WHERE admin=1"
ddev craft project-config/get system # not: reading project.yaml manually
ddev craft resave/entries            # not: UPDATE queries on content tables
ddev craft elements/delete           # not: DELETE FROM elements
```

Only fall back to `ddev mysql` when no CLI equivalent exists (e.g., checking table schemas, debugging specific rows, `TRUNCATE cache` for stuck mutex locks). Craft CLI commands handle project config, search index updates, and event firing that raw SQL skips.

## Shorthand Commands

Always use DDEV shorthand over `ddev exec`:

```bash
ddev composer install          # not ddev exec composer install
ddev craft up                  # not ddev exec php craft up
ddev npm install               # not ddev exec npm install
ddev craft make service        # scaffolding
```

## Craft CMS Project Type

```yaml
# .ddev/config.yaml
name: my-craft-site
type: craftcms
docroot: web
php_version: "8.3"
database:
  type: mysql
  version: "8.0"
nodejs_version: "20"
```

DDEV auto-injects: `CRAFT_DB_SERVER`, `CRAFT_DB_USER`, `CRAFT_DB_PASSWORD`, `CRAFT_DB_DATABASE`, `PRIMARY_SITE_URL`. These are injected into the container via `.ddev/.env.web` and can be opted out of with `disable_settings_management: true` in `.ddev/config.yaml`.

## New Project Bootstrap

The canonical flow for a fresh DDEV + Craft project:

```bash
mkdir my-craft-site && cd my-craft-site
ddev config --project-type=craftcms --docroot=web   # writes .ddev/config.yaml
ddev start
ddev composer create-project craftcms/craft         # Craft's setup wizard runs automatically
```

`ddev composer create-project` launches Craft's interactive install wizard on completion. If it doesn't run (or you need to re-run it), use `ddev craft install`. Swap `craftcms/craft` for a community starter project to bootstrap from one instead.

## Common Commands

```bash
ddev start                     # Start the project
ddev stop                      # Stop the project
ddev restart                   # Restart containers
ddev ssh                       # SSH into web container
ddev describe                  # Show project info and URLs
ddev launch                    # Open the project in a browser
ddev launch -m                 # Open Mailpit (also --mailpit)
ddev logs                      # View container logs
ddev import-db --file=dump.sql # Import database
ddev export-db --file=dump.sql # Export database
ddev xdebug on                 # Enable Xdebug
ddev craft db/backup           # Craft database backup
```

## Post-Install Auto-Run

Composer scripts auto-run `craft up` after install/update:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "post-craft-update": [
            "@php craft install/check && php craft up --interactive=0 || exit 0"
        ],
        "post-update-cmd": "@post-craft-update",
        "post-install-cmd": "@post-craft-update"
    }
}
```

No need to manually run `ddev craft migrate/all` or `ddev craft project-config/apply` — `ddev craft up` does both, and it auto-runs after `ddev composer install/update`.

## Add-ons

```bash
ddev add-on get ddev/ddev-redis       # Install Redis
ddev add-on list                       # List installed add-ons
ddev add-on remove ddev/ddev-redis    # Remove add-on
```

Mailpit is built into DDEV core — no add-on installation needed. Outgoing mail is captured automatically. Access the web UI with `ddev mailpit`, or `ddev describe` shows its URL (e.g. `https://{project}.ddev.site:8026`).

## Sharing a Local Site

```bash
ddev share                     # Expose the project on a temporary public URL
```

`ddev share` defaults to the ngrok provider, which requires a free ngrok.com account and a configured ngrok auth token. (`cloudflared` is an alternative provider via `--provider=cloudflared`, no account required, but ngrok is the default.)

## Custom Commands

Place scripts in `.ddev/commands/web/` (container) or `.ddev/commands/host/` (host):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
## Description: Run ECS code style check
## Usage: check-cs
## Example: ddev check-cs

cd /var/www/html && composer check-cs
```

Note: omit `#ddev-generated` on custom commands you maintain — DDEV overwrites files with that comment during updates. Only add-on-managed commands should include it.

## Composer Path Repos and Volume Mounts

When developing plugins locally, Composer path repos symlink the plugin into `vendor/`. For this to work inside DDEV's Docker container, the host path must be volume-mounted so the symlink resolves.

### Setup

1. **composer.json** — use the local host path:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "path",
            "url": "/Users/Shared/dev/craft-plugins/v5/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

2. **docker-compose override** — mount the same path into the container. Create `.ddev/docker-compose.mounts.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    volumes:
      - /Users/Shared/dev/craft-plugins:/Users/Shared/dev/craft-plugins
```

The mount path inside the container must match the host path exactly — Composer creates absolute symlinks that must resolve in both contexts. Replace `/Users/Shared/dev/craft-plugins` with your actual plugin directory path.

3. **Require the plugin**: `ddev composer require vendor/plugin-handle:@dev`

### Common mistakes

- Using a Docker-internal path in `composer.json` `url` — the path must be the host filesystem path, not `/var/www/...`
- Forgetting the volume mount — `ddev composer install` succeeds but the symlink points nowhere inside the container
- Setting `"platform": {"php": "8.3"}` in `composer.json` `config` — don't. DDEV handles the PHP version via `.ddev/config.yaml`. Platform overrides cause dependency resolution mismatches between host and container, and prevent DDEV from managing version upgrades cleanly.

## Browser Debugging with Chrome DevTools MCP

The Chrome DevTools MCP server gives Claude Code direct browser access — inspect pages, read console logs, check network requests, capture screenshots, and interact with the DOM.

### Installation

```bash
claude mcp add chrome-devtools -- npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest
```

Quit and reopen Claude Code to load the new MCP server. Requires Chrome or Chromium running — the MCP server handles the DevTools Protocol connection automatically.

### What it enables

| Capability | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| **Page inspection** | Check rendered HTML, verify template output, inspect meta tags |
| **Console logs** | Catch Twig errors, JS exceptions, Garnish initialization failures |
| **Network requests** | Debug 404 assets, failed AJAX calls, Sprig/htmx swaps |
| **DOM queries** | Verify form markup, check field rendering, validate ARIA attributes |
| **Screenshots** | Visual verification of CP templates, responsive testing |
| **Navigation & login** | Authenticate into the CP, navigate to plugin settings/edit pages |

### When to use

- **Front-end template debugging** — 404s, missing assets, broken layouts, SEOmatic meta tag verification
- **CP template verification** — plugin settings pages render correctly, editable tables work, slideout editors load
- **Garnish/JS debugging** — modals, drag-sort, disclosure menus initialize without console errors
- **Sprig/htmx debugging** — watch network requests for htmx swaps, verify response HTML fragments
- **Auth flow testing** — walk through login, registration, password reset end-to-end
- **Read-only mode verification** — confirm settings pages display correctly with `allowAdminChanges` off
- **Visual regression** — screenshot before/after template changes

### CP authentication pattern

DDEV sites are accessible at `https://{project}.ddev.site`. To inspect CP pages:

1. Navigate to `https://{project}.ddev.site/{cpTrigger}`
2. Log in with admin credentials
3. Navigate to the plugin/settings page to inspect
4. Check console for JS errors, inspect DOM for correct markup

### Project setup

The `craft-project-setup` skill offers to install Chrome DevTools MCP during scaffolding. If installed later, run `claude mcp add chrome-devtools -- npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest` from the project root — this writes to the project's `.claude.json`, keeping it project-level.

## Running a Plugin's Own Test Suite

When a plugin is symlinked into a host project, run its suite **from the plugin's own directory** inside the container:

```bash
ddev exec --dir /var/www/html/vendor/acme/my-plugin vendor/bin/pest
ddev exec --dir /var/www/html/vendor/acme/my-plugin composer test
```

`--dir` sets the working directory, and that is the load-bearing part. `markhuot/craft-pest-core` reads its environment overrides from `getcwd().'/phpunit.xml(.dist)'` only — it does **not** parse a `--configuration=` flag. So the shared-root form:

```bash
# UNSAFE — runs the tests, but against the project's live database
ddev craft pest -- --configuration=vendor/acme/my-plugin/phpunit.xml.dist
```

…discovers and executes the plugin's tests while silently ignoring the plugin's own `CRAFT_DB_DATABASE` pin. Combined with a suite that hasn't bound the `RefreshesDatabase` trait (rollback is opt-in), that writes test data permanently into your development database. Treat the shared-root invocation as unsafe for any craft-pest-core suite.

The full mechanism, the isolation checklist, and the CI equivalent are in the `craft-pest` skill (`references/isolation.md`).

For plugins mounted via a Composer path repo, the `--dir` path is the symlink target inside the container — see [Composer Path Repos and Volume Mounts](#composer-path-repos-and-volume-mounts) for making that path resolve.

## Troubleshooting

```bash
ddev poweroff                  # Stop all DDEV projects
ddev debug router              # Debug router configuration
ddev debug capabilities        # Check Docker capabilities
ddev delete --omit-snapshot    # Remove project without snapshot
```

### A general-config edit isn't taking effect (ddev-injected env var wins)

DDEV auto-injects Craft env vars (including `PRIMARY_SITE_URL`, and `CRAFT_DB_*`) into the container via `.ddev/.env.web`, and **regenerates that file on every `ddev start`/restart** unless `disable_settings_management: true` is set in `.ddev/config.yaml`. Because a real container environment variable beats a `cms/.env` dotenv value, and `CRAFT_*` env vars beat `config/general.php` (see the `craftcms` skill's `config-bootstrap.md`), a value you edit in `.env` or `general.php` can be silently overridden by what ddev injected.

Two symptoms and fixes:

- **Wrong site URL / scheme.** `PRIMARY_SITE_URL` follows ddev's primary URL, whose scheme is often `http`; if Craft resolves an unexpected base URL, that injected var is the likely source. Point Craft's site URL at a **differently-named** env var (e.g. `SITE_URL`) in your site config so ddev's `PRIMARY_SITE_URL` doesn't shadow it, or override `PRIMARY_SITE_URL` deliberately.
- **A `.env` change reverts after restart.** If you edited `.ddev/.env.web` by hand, it's regenerated on restart — put durable overrides in `.ddev/config.yaml` (`web_environment`) or set `disable_settings_management: true` to own the file yourself.

When a config value "won't change," check the resolved environment (`ddev exec printenv | grep CRAFT_`, and `.ddev/.env.web`) before editing PHP again.
