# Releasing Craft Plugins

A plugin release involves three independent systems that all claim to describe the same version: **git tags**, **Packagist**, and **GitHub release objects**. They drift from each other silently, and every observable signal can say "success" while consumers get nothing. This skill is the checklist and risk model for keeping them in agreement.

**Core rule: verify what each system actually serves, not what you pushed to it.** A `202 Accepted` from the Packagist webhook, a green tag push, and a rendered releases page each prove nothing about the other two.

## Companion Skills

- **`craft-php-guidelines`** — `references/tooling.md` for commit conventions and composer hygiene of the plugin manifest itself.
- **`craftcms`** — `references/quality.md` for the CI workflows a release depends on (`code-analysis`, `create-release.yml`).
- **`craft-pest`** — the suite must be green from the plugin's own root before tagging.

## The release commit

If the plugin's `composer.json` carries a `version` key, **bumping it is a mandatory release step, in the same commit that dates the changelog.** A tag whose `composer.json` says a different version is silently useless: Packagist reads the manifest from the tag's own tree, sees the mismatch, and skips the tag —

```
Reading composer.json of acme/craft-thing (1.7.4)
Skipped tag 1.7.4, tag (1.7.4.0) does not match version (1.7.3.0) in composer.json
```

— while the GitHub webhook still returns `202 Accepted`. Nothing in the push, the tag, or the webhook response surfaces this. Consumers simply never see the version.

After tagging, verify against the **tag's own blob**, not the branch head:

```bash
git show 1.7.4:composer.json | grep '"version"'
```

The branch can be correct while the tag isn't (the bump landed one commit after the tag), and vice versa.

### The `version` key: bump it or omit it

Composer's schema documentation recommends **omitting** `version` for VCS-distributed packages — the tag is the version, and an explicit key is a drift risk that `composer validate` warns about. Both choices are legitimate; know the trade-off:

- **Omit it**: the entire class of skipped-tag failures disappears. But a version-less package loaded through a `path` repository resolves as `dev-<branch>`, and `version_compare("dev-develop-v5", "5.9.0", ">=")` is **false** — any peer-plugin version check silently fails, and the CP shows a branch name where a version should be. `extra.branch-alias` mitigates this (see `references/path-repositories.md`).
- **Keep it**: local path-repository development gets a real, comparable version. The cost is that every release must bump it, enforced by the same-commit rule and the tag-blob check above. A release script that edits changelog date + `version` together and refuses to tag on mismatch removes the human step.

Present this as a per-plugin decision, not a doctrine — but whichever way a repo goes, it must go all the way: a `version` key that exists and doesn't get bumped is strictly worse than either consistent choice.

## Verifying Packagist

**Check `https://repo.packagist.org/p2/<vendor>/<name>.json`** — the metadata endpoint Composer itself resolves from. Do **not** use `https://packagist.org/packages/<vendor>/<name>.json`; it is served from a staler pipeline and can show a version p2 doesn't have (or lack one it does).

```bash
curl -s https://repo.packagist.org/p2/acme/craft-thing.json | jq -r '.packages["acme/craft-thing"][].version'
```

Compare that list against `git tag --list` — every releasable tag should appear. A tag missing here with no error anywhere is the skipped-tag failure above; fetch the package's update log on packagist.org (or re-trigger the webhook and watch the response body) to see the skip reason.

### The tag risk model

- **Recreating a tag Packagist has never served is safe.** Nothing downstream has cached that version, so delete-and-repush (with the fixed manifest) is the standard remedy for a skipped tag.
- **Moving a tag Packagist HAS served breaks that version permanently.** Composer's metadata and dist archives are cached by reference; a moved served tag means checksum mismatches and split-brain installs. Ship a new patch version instead.

That distinction is the whole model. Before touching any existing tag, check p2 for whether the version was ever served.

## GitHub release objects are not tags

A GitHub *release* is a separate object that references a tag — and the two drift independently. Packagist reads **tags**; humans read the **releases page**. A repo can be tagged several versions past its newest release object, so the releases page lies while Packagist is correct. Verify both:

```bash
git ls-remote --tags origin | tail -5
gh release list --limit 5
```

Editing and publishing pitfalls, each observed in practice:

- **`gh api -X PATCH /repos/O/R/releases/<id>` with only a `body` field wipes `tag_name`** — the release becomes `untagged-<hash>`, silently unbound from its tag. Update notes with `gh release edit <tag> --notes-file <file>` instead, then re-verify `tag_name`, `draft`, `prerelease`, and `target_commitish` on the release object.
- **`gh api repos/O/R/releases/latest` returns 404 when every release is a prerelease** — that endpoint excludes prereleases and drafts by design. Not a bug; use `gh release list` instead of chasing it.
- **Publishing a draft release mints its tag from the tip of `target_commitish` at publish time.** Anything pushed to that branch between drafting and publishing lands in the release. Useful when intentional; a footgun when the branch moved. Pin the draft to a SHA, or verify the branch tip immediately before publishing.

## Branch promotion: never trust local refs

When deciding what to promote from a development branch to a release branch, stale local refs produce confidently wrong answers. Always:

```bash
git fetch --prune origin
git rev-list --left-right --count origin/develop...origin/main
```

Compare **origin against origin, in both directions**. A one-way "commits behind" count cannot distinguish *behind* from *diverged*, and cannot detect an *inverted* pair (release branch ahead of the dev branch) — both of which occur in real estates and both of which make a naive promotion destructive.

## Release verification checklist

1. Suite green from the plugin's own root; `check-cs` and `phpstan` pass.
2. Changelog dated and `composer.json` `version` bumped (if present) **in the same commit**.
3. Tag created; `git show <tag>:composer.json` shows the right version.
4. `repo.packagist.org/p2/<name>.json` lists the new version (allow a minute for the webhook).
5. GitHub release object exists, `tag_name` matches, `prerelease`/`draft` flags correct.
6. If promoting branches first: `git fetch --prune`, two-way `origin...origin` comparison, no unexplained divergence.
