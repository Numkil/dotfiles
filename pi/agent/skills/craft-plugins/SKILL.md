description: "Index and router for Craft CMS 5 plugin-specific guidance — configuration, Twig API, PHP API, migrations, deployment, pitfalls. Routes plugin tasks across front-end, back-end PHP, content modeling, or deployment. Triggers on any named plugin: Formie, SEOmatic, Blitz, Feed Me, Imager-X, ImageOptimize, CKEditor, Sprig, Element API, Retour, Navigation, Hyper, Colour Swatches, Password Policy, Typogrify, Cache Igniter, Knock Knock, Elements Panel, Sherlock, Amazon SES, Embedded Assets, Timeloop, Vite, Warp (passwordless auth). Also load for passwordless/magic-link auth. Always load when a task names a plugin — read references/<plugin>.md first. NOT for Craft core (craftcms), template architecture (craft-site), or content modeling (craft-content-modeling)."

# Craft CMS 5 — Plugin References (Index & Router)

This skill is a **router**, not a tutorial. Its job is to make per-plugin
guidance discoverable from any task framing — front-end, back-end PHP, content
migration, deployment, or config — and point you at the right reference file.

Each plugin's curated reference lives in `references/<plugin>.md` and covers
configuration, the Twig and/or PHP API, and the real-world pitfalls. Read the
matching reference **before** implementing anything plugin-specific.

## How to use this skill

1. Identify the plugin(s) named in the task (by name, package, or feature).
2. Open the matching `references/<plugin>.md` from the table below.
3. If the task is back-end (PHP, content migration, events, deployment), check
   the reference's back-end / programmatic sections specifically — several
   plugins (Formie, Feed Me, Element API, Amazon SES) are primarily or
   substantially back-end despite historically living under the front-end skill.

## Routing table

## Companion skills

- **`craftcms`** — for the Craft core APIs a plugin task builds on: element saving, events, migrations, queue jobs, field-value storage. Load alongside this skill for any plugin **PHP/migration** work.
- **`craft-site`** — for front-end template architecture the plugin output slots into (components, layouts, image presets). Load alongside this skill for plugin **rendering/styling** work.
- **`craft-content-modeling`** — when the plugin interacts with sections, fields, volumes, or multi-site propagation.
- **`craft-cloud` / `servd`** — when the plugin task involves deployment, edge caching, or ephemeral-filesystem constraints.
